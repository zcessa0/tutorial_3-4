# COMP0035 Tutorials: Data preparation and understanding

## Set-up

You will need a coding environment that has Python and the pandas, matplotlib and openpyxl libraries.

1. Sign in to GitHub and go to <https://github.com/nicholsons/comp0035_tutorial3> 
2. Select 'Use this template' which will create a copy of the repository in your account
3. In your IDE, create a new python project by creating a clone of the repository you just created in your account
4. Create and activate a new virtual environment (or activate an existing environment) in the project
5. Install pandas, matplotlib and openpyxl e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`) in the virtual environment

## Data

The data in the activities is from the following sources:

- [London 2012 Ticket Sales](https://data.london.gov.uk/download/london-2012-ticket-sales/4711eb39-cb56-4f47-804d-e486dae89a1d/assembly-london-2012-ticket-sales.xls)
- [Paralympic medals and event info](https://www.paralympic.org/london-2012/results/medalstandings)

The data has been modified such that it can be used for a data cleaning activity.

You can either use your own dataset for this or [paralympics_raw.csv](data/paralympics_raw.csv) from the directory. If
using your own then place a copy in the `/data` directory of the project.
